## Transfer Notes

This document summarizes the current state of the project and the debugging steps taken.

**Current Focus:**

*   **Debugging Package Details Modal:** The primary issue is that the package details modal (`frontend/src/components/PackageDetailsModal.jsx`) is not displaying correct information for packages fetched from Travel Compositor, even though the backend is successfully retrieving and normalizing the data.

**Recent Changes & Debugging Steps:**

1.  **Attempted Three.js Animation on 'Nosotros' Page:**
    *   Implemented `ParticleHero.tsx` for a particle background using `three` and `@react-three/fiber`.
    *   Encountered `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'S')` and `THREE.WebGLRenderer: Context Lost` errors, indicating a fundamental issue with Three.js initialization or context.
    *   Attempted to simplify `PointMaterial` properties and use `pointsMaterial` directly, but the core error persisted.
    *   **Current State:** To unblock debugging of the package modal, the `ParticleHero` component has been temporarily disabled on `frontend/src/app/nosotros/page.tsx`, and `ParticleHero.tsx` itself has been simplified to render a static background. This should resolve the Three.js related errors.

2.  **Debugging Package Details (Backend & Frontend ID Mismatch):**
    *   Initial problem: `404 (Not Found)` when requesting package details from the backend.
    *   Identified that the `id` passed from the frontend to the backend for package details was not matching the `id` expected by Travel Compositor.
    *   **Backend (`backend/travel-compositor-fast.js`):**
        *   Modified `normalizePackage` to correctly map various fields from Travel Compositor's raw package data to the expected frontend structure (e.g., `pkg.name` to `title`, `pkg.description` to `description.short/full`, `pkg.imageUrls` to `images.main/gallery`, `pkg.itinerary` to `itinerary`, `pkg.includedServices` to `included`, `pkg.nonIncludedServices` to `notIncluded`).
        *   Added `stripHtml` helper to clean HTML tags from descriptions.
        *   **Crucially, changed `normalizePackage` to use `pkg.externalReference || pkg.id` as the primary ID for packages.** This was based on the observation that `externalReference` seemed to be the consistent identifier for detail lookups.
        *   Modified `getPackageDetails` to correctly extract the package object from `response.data.closedTours`, `transports`, or `hotels` arrays.
    *   **Frontend (`frontend/src/app/paquetes/page.tsx`):**
        *   Implemented `encodeURIComponent(pkg.id)` when passing the package ID to the modal to handle special characters in URLs.
    *   **Backend (`backend/server.js`):**
        *   Implemented `decodeURIComponent(id)` when receiving the package ID in the `/api/packages/:id` route.

**Next Steps:**

*   Verify that the 'Nosotros' page loads without Three.js errors.
*   Re-test the package details modal to confirm it now displays correct information for Travel Compositor packages.
*   If the package details are still incorrect, further debugging will focus on the exact data structure received by `PackageDetailsModal.jsx` and its rendering logic.
